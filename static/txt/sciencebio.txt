Science and Technology are Important to me.

I am currently working on a research project at Georgia Tech, where I use
MATLAB, Bash, and PBS scripts to help analyze brain data collected from mice.
I work with the Precision Biosystems Laboratory, specifically under Ilya Kolb,
an ME PhD student, and Dr. Singer, an Assistant Professor of Neuroscience in the
BME department.

I'm very lucky to be working in an environment with such kind,
hardworking, and intellectual individuals, and the experience
has been both humbling and rewarding. I've been able to meet experts in the
field and learn new skills in programming and data analysis every day.

I hope to take the technical skills I have developed in statistics and
programming and apply them to other cutting edge areas in STEM. I am
eager to jump on any new and interesting ideas, and motivated enough to make
them become the future's realities.
